# Regular Expressions Workshop


## **About Me**


Erich Purpur

    Research Librarian for Science & Engineering
    epurpur@virginia.edu
    Brown Science & Engineering Library room I046


I'm a part of a group called [research data services](https://data.library.virginia.edu/) and I do these things:
    
    1. Serve as Liaison to various engineering departments
    2. Teach workshops and classes (like this one)
    3. Help people with research projects
    4. Random other things as they come up

## Welcome to the UVA Library
* [Research Data Services](https://data.library.virginia.edu/)
* [Workshop Series](https://data.library.virginia.edu/training/)

## ** Regular Expressions **
A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp also referred to as rational expression) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.

Regular expressions can be used in most if not all programming languages. They are like a mini-language in themselves. While they can be somewhat difficult to read, with a little practice they are not overly complicated.

### Note of interest
Because regular expressions are language agnostic, I have provided examples of how to use them for both Python (regularexpressions.ipynb) and R (regularexpressions.rmd). I am not an R user so I did my best to translate the python examples to R. The regular expressions themselves between the two languages are nearly identical, so you can translate from one language to another. I am sure my R code is not good so please cut me some slack!

### ** Self Help **
### You don't need to remember all this

### ChatGPT
ChatGPT has quickly made huge changes to the programming landscape. It is a hugely powerful tool **If you use it the right way!**. I think it is a somewhat slippery slope of how to advise new programmers to use ChatGPT (or other AI tools) so I will refer to some best practices. My personal opinion is that you should use AI minimally when you are starting. When you have a better grasp of basic fundamentals, then you can include AI and greatly increase your speed. **Never accept ChatGPT code verbatim!** Always double check it before including it in your workflows. I find existing regular expressions difficult to interpret myself and I think ChatGPT very useful for reverse engineering them.

I heavily used these youtube videos to create this workshop. I used these when I was first learning regular expressions. Regular Expressions are not something I use regularly so every time I needd to use them, I refer to these videos. I more or less re-created these youtube tutorials for this workshops because I didn't think I could do any better! These videos are very clearly explained and easy to follow. I highly recommend them.

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) 

StackOverflow is a huge user community Q&A type site. Odds are very high that someone has 
asked your question before, just google something like "how to make scatter plot matlplotlib python". I'm pretty certain a 
StackOverflow thread will be one of the first few search results
